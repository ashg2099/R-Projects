    "### Explanation \n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to build a robust classification model to predict the 'perfectMentalHealth' category using survey responses. The approach involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and model tuning to enhance the accuracy of the predictions. The Random Forest model was chosen due to its efficiency in handling high-dimensional data and its ability to perform feature selection automatically, leading to improved model performance and interpretability. \n",
    "To ensure the model's performance is thoroughly tested and results are reproducible, we used the set.seed function. This ensures that the random processes such as data splitting and model training yield consistent results across different runs, making our model's performance reliable and comparable. By setting a seed, we can confirm that the model is robust and that its performance metrics, such as accuracy, are stable and not subject to random variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model usage justification\n",
    "Random Forest was selected for this task because of its proven effectiveness in dealing with complex, high-dimensional datasets. It handles both continuous and categorical variables well and is less prone to overfitting compared to other models. Additionally, Random Forests can provide insights into feature importance, making it a powerful tool for this multi-class classification problem. While other models like SVM or neural networks could be used, Random Forest offers a good balance of accuracy, interpretability, and ease of implementation, making it the preferred choice for this competition."
